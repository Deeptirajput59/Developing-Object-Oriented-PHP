# Developing-Object-Oriented-PHP
The PHP programs I have written so far have mostly been self containedâ€”that is, most elements of the code, such as variables, statements, and functions, exist within a script section. For example, I might create a Web page for an online retailer that uses PHP to calculate the total for a sales order, including state sales tax and shipping. However, suppose the retailer sells different types of products on different Web pages, with one page selling apparel, another page selling electronics, and so on. If I want to reuse the code that calculates sales totals on multiple Web pages, I must copy all of the statements or recreate them from scratch for each Web page. Object oriented programming takes a different approach. Essentially, object oriented programming allows us to use and create objects, which are complex data structures built of variables and functions that work together to represent a single entity. In other words, object-oriented programming allows us to hide a complex logical construct behind a simple interface.
